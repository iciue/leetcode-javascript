 *
 * In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can
 * reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original
 * data.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two
 * positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of
 * the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.
 * 
 * ⁠The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original
 * matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal,
 * output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * nums = 
 * [[1,2],
 * ⁠[3,4]]
 * r = 1, c = 4
 * Output: 
 * [[1,2,3,4]]
 * Explanation:The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix
 * is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * nums = 
 * [[1,2],
 * ⁠[3,4]]
 * r = 2, c = 4
 * Output: 
 * [[1,2],
 * ⁠[3,4]]
 * Explanation:There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So
 * output the original matrix.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
 * The given r and c are all positive.
 *
